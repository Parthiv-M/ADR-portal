# KMC Alternative Dispute Resolution portal
The portal for alternative dispute resolution for Kasturba Medical Hospital built using RemixJS (TypeScript), Ant Design Components and TailwindCSS for simpicity.

## Installation Guide
Before anything else, make sure that you have the latest NodeJS binaries installed on your system. If not, you can download it from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). To test this portal on your local system, you'll need to download the code from the repository onto your local system. To do so, click the download button below. A `ADR-portal-main.zip` file will be downloaded to your default download location.<br /><br />

<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Once that is done, the following steps can be followed to install the portal on your PC/Mac:
1. Operating System Wise: 
  - **Windows**: Open the unzipped folder and open it in Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Windows Terminal by right clicking in the folder. 
  - **Mac**: Refer [this thread](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/11323/how-can-i-open-a-terminal-window-directly-from-my-current-finder-location) on StackExchange to learn how to do it. Alternatively, drag the folder onto your terminal screen.
  - **Linux**: You should be smart enough to do this if you are using Linux.
2. Once you have done it, type `npm install` in the terminal window and press enter. This will take time based on your internet speed. _This is a one time step._ <br /> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27415791/160664455-1e5ce6f9-cedf-4777-9578-21a1d57c147b.png)
